Actual package models are based on &#x27;80s Unix model that do not scale anymore since decades. Such model was designed decoupling &quot;system code&quot; to &quot;user code&quot; (script, mostly) while all along the IT history, both before and after unix we see a better model (see below);<p>- packages in FLOSS are NOT meant do be made by upstream developers, that&#x27;s a need of <i>commercial only</i> software. In FLOSS systems packagers of any distro package upstream code.<p>Now a step at a time: classic systems where designed as a single application, indefinitively extensible by many, and users included. At a certain point in time AT&amp;T&#x2F;IBM and others say &quot;ah, no that&#x27;s bad&quot; IMVHO just to deprive users of much power and gain the ability to sell limited, limiting and poorly designed crap. For more than a decade such decoupling take shape. After decades of big mess frameworks spring to life as a kind of middle-ground and they prove to be no better than the decoupled crap they try to solve without coming back to the classic OS-as-a-single-application model. Now essentially ALL non trivial applications being unable to effectively integrate each others try to be &quot;the only one application&quot; and finding no way to do so some pull out of the hat an even worse cage: hiding the OS on someone else computer, used as a bootloader of a modern more limited and limiting Java VM: the WebVM improperly named browser for legacy reasons. Pushing &quot;the network is the computer&quot; to &quot;the cloud is the system&quot;.<p>To solve this mess what we need is the original solution: the OS as a single application where source code is in the runtime, no &quot;packaging&quot; just SCM. Oh, surely that does not solve version conflict between source, these actually are ALREADY solved in architectural terms by the FLOSS distribution model: packagers assemble code. But working directly on source makes that far easier with simple sharable patches who happen to be also a bit distro-neutral. Nix&#x2F;Guix offer the actual middle ground.<p>To solve the storage mess it&#x27;s far more complex. Today most solutions simply use a backend storage service, a kind of DB, no matter if SQL-alike or key-value or something else. SUN with zfs realize a very first limited evolution in that sense, but far from current needs.

It solves _a_lot_ of the problems mentioned. Guix (and all its channels) is a great piece of software, but unfortunately its potential for populartity is severely diminished by the insistence of the core user&#x2F;dev group that its goals are not purely technological, but ideological(perhaps even primarily ideological).<p>It seems that for many devs guix is less of a technical achievemt,and more a way of preventing people from being able to run what they call &quot;non free software&quot;. BTW, &quot;non free software&quot; also includes open source software that was released under certain non-compliant licenses.<p>The biggest issue I have with guix is that any effort of packaging &quot;non-free&quot; software (such as cuda, intel MKL, nvidia drivers etc). Is heavily discouraged, and if it it does happen its discussion is banned from official channels and all authors which make such software available in their personal repos seem to meekly include various pledges in the READMEs &quot;to not advertise this horrible evil thing, or otherwise let people know of its existence&quot;. To me this behaviour is very far away from encouraging &quot;free software&quot;, but my and their definition of free differ a lot.<p>My second issue with guix is that the language used to write everything(guile) still lacks many crucial debugging and ease-of-use features such as: being able to display more meanigful error messages, being able to show on which line of compiled code the error&#x2F;exception happens at, being able to easily interrogate variable value types (there seem to be lots of is_this_value_a_string?, or is_this_value_an_integer? functions, but no what_type_is_this?), no standard way to convert nested objects to string, or to pretty-print deeply nested objects. To this one has to add pretty substantial, but really poorely laid out documentation of the language (from the very first chapter the authors in their examples use all language features that may not be explained until 300 pages in - so the reader basically has to read the whole thing multiple times to &quot;get it&quot;). And so on... All those things matter a lot to beginners and they matter less to advanced users. If this language and guix in general is to catch on, it has to be more beginner friendly.<p>However as a package manager it really is pretty good.

These policies are in place because they&#x27;re necessary for releasing and maintaining a 50000 package distribution.<p>But for shipping your own software you&#x27;re free to ignore distribution policies. Package managers have always provided the necessary mechanism. Nothing is preventing you from shoving in <i>all</i> library, binary or data dependencies your program needs into a deb package.

In fact, I don&#x27;t remember the last time I encountered it, other than when it&#x27;s an explicit choice - like, Python can only have one version of a package installed for the system Python interpreter, so if you try to install both python-numpy and python-numpy-mkl-bin, well, you have to choose. That&#x27;s how Python works, though you can of course make additional Python environments (venv&#x2F;conda&#x2F;whatever) with different packages.<p>I notice the vscode example involves the AUR, which is not the official repositories. I consider that a broken package, and it should be fixed. One of the packages should rename its main executable or whatever.<p>Chrome, for example, has various versions, but they ship binaries with different names, e.g. &#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;google-chrome-stable.<p>The great thing about Arch is that there is one canonical user repository, the AUR. So the official repos should not have conflicts unless absolutely necessary, and the AUR should endeavour not to have conflicts, though it&#x27;s more of a wild-west so they&#x27;re somewhat more likely.<p>However, you generally don&#x27;t have to think about how to not conflict with whatever random packages may be out there - you only need to consider the repos and the AUR. Anyone making their own packages that are not in the official repos or the AUR, and yet conflict with them, well, that&#x27;s their problem.<p>Arch being super up to date and the existence of the AUR really does obviate the need for containerising apps to a large degree, at least from the perspective of ensuring dependencies are satisfied (there are still security reasons to want containerisation).
